;reminder
;space-> grows proportional to its max depth
;steps -> grows proportional to the number of nodes in the tree

;space -> O(n), it depends on the amount so a higher amount a higher space
;steps -> 
;with 1 type of coin
;O(n)
;with 2 types of coins
;O(n^2) . . .
;so with 5 types of coins
;O(n^5)

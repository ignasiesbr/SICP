;1.15

; a) How many times p is applied when we do (sine 12.15)
; 5 -> (p(p(p(p(p 0.02815)))))

;b) What is the order of growth as a function of a
;space-> each input size is increased by a factor of 3, 
;steps-> each 3 times the angle is incresead it increases 1 step.
;the increase of the input needed to increase the space or the steps of the algorithm is not linear
;because as the input grows with a factor of 3, the space and steps will only need 1 more extra step.
;so O(log(n))
;pretty hard to explain
;the idea behind it is that as the input grows from (example) 0 to 3 (3 in total) we need 1 step.
;but if the input grows from 1000 to 3000 (2000 in total) we still need only 1 extra step.
;this makes the O(log(n))

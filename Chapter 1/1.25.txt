;1.25
;Exercise 1.25. After all, she says, since we already know how to compute exponentials, 
;we could have simply written


(define (expmod base exp m)
  (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))

;Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime tester? Explain.

;No. It would produce the same results, but much slower.

;WHY?

;Because with the initial process, the program never touch large numbers
;Instead with fast-expt it uses very large numbers and this slows down the precess.

;What will happen if the intepreter is using applicative-order evaluation?
;applicative-order evaluates first the arguments and then apply, because (p) is infinitly refering to itself
;the process would never terminate.
;Normal-order?
;Because the normal order expands in a first place
;then the program would face the (= 0 0) #t and it wouldn't evaluate p
;result 0.

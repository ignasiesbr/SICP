;The sum procedure 

(define (sum term a next b)
  (if (> a b)
      0
      (+ (term a)
         (sum term (next a) next b))))

;generates a linear recursion. The procedure can be rewritten to generate an iterative process.
;fill the blanks.


(define (sum term a next b)
	(define (iter a result)
		(if (> a b)
		     result
		     (iter (next a) (+ (term a) result))))
	(iter a 0))

;to get it iterative, you have to keep track of every state variable at each step
;you use an accumulator (result) to keep track of the result of the sum.
